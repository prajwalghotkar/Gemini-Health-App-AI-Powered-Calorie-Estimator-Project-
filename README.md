## Gemini Health App üçé - An AI-Powered Nutrition & Wellness Tracker
---
##### Project Overview
- The Gemini Health App is a cutting-edge, interactive web application designed to revolutionize personal health management. Built with Streamlit and powered by the Google Gemini-1.5-Flash API, this app provides users with instant, detailed nutritional analysis of their meals through a simple photo upload. It goes beyond basic calorie counting to offer a comprehensive, personalized health tracking experience.

- This project showcases expertise in multimodal AI applications, data persistence for stateful web apps, and the development of a clean, user-friendly interface. It's a complete end-to-end solution that demonstrates a strong foundation in modern web development and machine learning integration.
---
##### Key Features & Technical Highlights
###### ***This project stands out by integrating a powerful AI model into a practical, real-world application, showcasing a blend of front-end development, back-end logic, and AI model utilization.***

###### 1. Advanced Multimodal AI Integration (Gemini-1.5-Flash)
- **Visual Analysis**: The core of the app uses the Gemini-1.5-Flash Vision model to analyze images of food. The model intelligently identifies multiple food items, a task that requires sophisticated computer vision capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Nutritional Breakdown**: The app doesn't just count calories. It leverages a custom-engineered prompt to extract a detailed nutritional report, including macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats) for each item. This demonstrates a deep understanding of prompt engineering to get specific, structured data from a large language model.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, the app provides smart, context-aware suggestions for healthier alternatives or additions to a meal.

###### 2. User Profile & Data Persistence
- **Stateful Application Logic**: Unlike typical, stateless Streamlit apps, this project uses st.session_state to maintain user data across interactions. This is a crucial skill for building dynamic applications.
- **Personal Health Logging**: Users can log their weight over time, and the app visualizes this progress with a dynamic line chart. This feature demonstrates an understanding of data visualization and user-centric design.
- **Meal History**: Every meal analyzed is saved to a persistent session log, allowing users to review their dietary history. This shows an ability to build and manage simple databases or data logs.

###### 3. Clean & Intuitive User Interface
- **Streamlit Framework**: The entire application is built using Streamlit, highlighting proficiency in quickly building and deploying interactive data applications with pure Python.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout, with its use of st.columns and st.expander, is well-organized and easy to navigate, demonstrating an eye for UI/UX design.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes robust try-except blocks to gracefully handle potential issues like missing file uploads, providing a smooth user experience.
